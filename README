# RESTful-web-app
Demo RESTful web application that controls access to a simple database containing tables users, artists, albums and songs

This demo web application is designed to show the basics of the following web application architecture concepts:
* Portability
* Test Driven Development (TDD)
* Use of Model View Controller (MVC) pattern throughout
* Use of a PDO DB manager and DOA pattern
* Use of DRY principle to show code refactoring
* SHA256 authentication with username and password access
* Show different response formats such as JSON and XML
* Basic HTTP response codes
* Different ROUTES and CRUD operations

To use, first download XAMPP (this was tested on Windows only):
https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

Once installed, start it up (might need to do it in Administrator Mode on Windows).
Then start the Apache and MySQL modules.

Load up PHPMyAdmin in your browser and create a database using the 'music_database.sql' file in this repo as an example.

Create a new directory for this project under "xampp/htdocs" and then clone this into it.

You may need to turn off the authentaication function while you get your database set up. Once you have that done,
you can re-enable it and pass the following headers when using the app:
username = foo
password = bar
